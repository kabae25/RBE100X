Install: 
vscode
nodejs.org/en <---- this is the big missing one bleh 

Extensions: 
python 
pymakr

We need to run xrp in the online IDE to initialize the board 

How to run scripts: 

1) When we plug in the device we should see it appear under "DEVICES" in the "PyMaker" tab
2) Click the lightning bolt by its name to connect the device
3) We have to make a new project ("Projects" under "PyMaker")
	a) It will ask you to select a template. Click the option for the board and it will download 
		all of the board files into your folder
	b) If we have not connected the board yet, we can simply click download by the device name after the project is made
	c) If you see neither option, try rightclicking on the board and hitting stop script 
4) We need to link the project to the board under "Projects" 
5) Now we can click create a terminal to allow us to print things from the XRP
6) To put a specific code on the board, we need to include its filename in "main.py"
7) When ready we can click upload by the device name
8) We then need to right click on the device and select hard reset (you can also just press reset on the board)
9) Finally we have to reconnect to see the terminal output (Note: If it tries to print before you reconnect, you simply won't see it)

* Note: by the project folder name, we can select developer mode.
By default, all files on the board are deleted and the entire project folder is reuploaded. 
In dev mode, it will only update necessary files. 
Saving the file will automatically upload it to the board and will run the script. (so no steps 6-8)

** Note: in VScode we can move the tabs around by dragging and dropping
	i.e. in the explore tab, we can drag and drop "projects" and "devices" so we can see them with the files

*** Note: if there are yellow squiggles under XRPLib imports add lib (lib.XRPLib) to check another folder down
